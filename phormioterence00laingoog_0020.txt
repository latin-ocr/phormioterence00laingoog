iambic octonarius were ¹recited to a musical accom-
paniment, while the lyric parts, in which there are
frequent changes of meter, were sung to a set
tune.

The iambio senarius is so called because it consiste
of six iambi ( .). It is also called the iambic trim-
eter on the ground that the uuit is not the single
iambic ioot, but the iambic dipody (pair oi feet:
ν ι c .) in which the first thesis (accented part of
the foot) is stronger than the second.

For the iambus ( ι) may be substituted:

thetribrach: c c ν

the spondeo: . ι

thedactyl: - c o
theanapeest: 2 o ι

the proceleusmaticus: 2 o c c

Anw substitution is allowed in any ioot with the f l-
lowing exceptione: (1) the last foot is always an
iambus or a pyrrhic () treated as an iambus; (2) ’

the proceleusmaticus probably does not occur in the
fifth foot.
