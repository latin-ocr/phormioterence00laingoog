sequences of his evil doing, for in the wrangle that
took place between the two old men and Phormio

1. Α long syllable preceded by a short· is frequently
shortened when the short syllable preceding or the
ι syllable following hae the ictus. The short preced-
ing, however, must be a monosyllable or be at the be-
’ ginning of a word. This is called the “Iambio law,’‘

because it affecte iambio (-) combinatione. Ex-

prtdr bibare,¹ 800 quid istuc· 809 dd ipsam.

2‘. Final s does not always “make position‚'' e. g,
660 iooertds sunm 683 inseris sum.

3. Sometimes, before a word beginning with a
consonant, the final e of ille, iude, uude, quippe, and
nempe is suppressed, e. g, 109 ilde) qui; 681 iud(e)
alimum· 307 oemp(e) Phdrmiooem.

4. There were originally no double consonante in
Latin. Even after their introduction there seems ,
to have been uncertainty about the pronunciation of
some syllables. For example the first syllable in
immo is sometimes short: 5283 936.
