PREFACE

This edition of the Phormio is intended primarily
for students who make their first acquaintance with
Roman 'comedy by reading the- Phormio. On this
account all deviatIons from the classical norm, whether
in forms, syntax, or vocabulary, have been explained,
and difficult passages translated. The explanatione,
however, have been kept within strict limits. Only
enough has been given in each case to make
the text intelligible to the student. Where further
discussion of the points touched on is desirable, it
Is best given cicc cccc by the instructor. For the
same reason the Introduction has been limited to a
brief statement of essentials It is assumed that
the regular recitations will be supplemented by lectures
by the instructor or class papers by the students
dealing with such subjects as the origin and develop-
⁵ ment of Roman comedy, the relation of Plautus' and
Terence’s plays to their Greek prototypes, the char-
acteristic features ,of the fabata palliato and of the
lobrda topctc, the occasions on which plays were pro-
duced in Rome and the methods of presentation,
the Influence of Roman comedy upon the drama of
Italy, France, Germany and England, and so forth.
II the instructor lecturos on these subJects he will
naturally seek his material from more comprehensive
sources than the Introduction of a college text-book.
If a student is required to write a paper cn any of

them, it is better that he should be sent to the library
