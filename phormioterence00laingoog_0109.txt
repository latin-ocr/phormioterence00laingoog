the old men aud doing Phaedria a favor.

PHORMIO

Tantam fortunam dc inprouiso esse his datam!

Summa eludendi occasiost mihi minc senes aas

Et Phaedriae curam adimere argentariam,

Ne quoiquam suorum aequilium supplex sict.

Nam idem hoc argentum, ita rit datumst, ingratiis

Ei datum erit; hoc qui cogam, re ipsa repperi.

Nunc gestus mihi uoltusque est capiundis nouos. ano

Sed hinc concedam in angiportum hoc proxumum,

Inde hisce ostendam me, ribi erunt egressi foras.

Quo me adsimularam ire ad mercatum, non eo. (With-
drcwa into olley).

Sonus 8 ,

Phormio comes iorward stating his willingness to marry
Phanium at once. Demipho tells him that on his bmther's
advice he has decidcd not to send Phanium away; and as Phormio
is no longer required to marry the girl, he must give back the
money that has been paid to him. Phormio refuses to do so
and says that if they attempt to iorcc him to pay it he will
tell Nausistrata about Chremes’ lemnian wife. “
